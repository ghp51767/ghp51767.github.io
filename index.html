    <p>The University of Georgia's 2017 football team currently has one of the nation's best running backs. His name is Nick Chubb. Nick Chubb is a senior at the University, and he has been a starter on the football team since his freshman year. Not only is he one of the best in the nation, but he is currently chasing one of UGA's most untouchable records: career rushing yards. The record has been held by Herschel Walker since he left the school in 1981. Many running backs since then have attempted to reach this record, but Nick Chubb has gotten the closest to acheiving this feat. Many believe that Nick Chubb will break this record by the end of the season, but I do not think this is possible considering there are only a few games remaining in his career at Georgia.Although he may not be the number one rusher in the unviersity's history, he will always be my favorite running back.

	 <p> All four of these running backs will have their names remembered for many years to come considering how difficult it is to achieve this feat. However, the University of Georgia Football team has recently gotten a few recruits who could potentially challenge this record in the years to come. They are three of the most highly sought after runners at the high school level, and they will fit right in on the football team that has been dubbed "RBU". The running backs of the future are as follows (remember these names!):</p>

  				<li>Justin Fields</li>
 				<li>Zamir White</li>
				<li>James Cook</li>
